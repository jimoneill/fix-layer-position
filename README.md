# Fix Layer Position

A Sketch plugin that lets you quickly move a layer to a predetermined (X,Y) position.

## Why?

This plugin is designed to speed up the following repetitive task that I do every day (and I assume I'm not alone):

1. View some page in my web application, in a browser.
2. Take a screenshot of the browser window, at the same viewport size every time.
3. Paste the screenshot into Sketch, using the same artboard size every time, so that I can start designing & editing on top of the screenshot.
